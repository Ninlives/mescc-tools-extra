These are a collection of tools written for use in bootstrapping

# blood-elf
A tool for generating ELF debug tables in M1-macro format from M1-macro assembly files

# exec_enable
A tool for marking files as executable, for systems that don't have chmod

# get_machine
A tool for identifying what hardware architecture you are running on

# kaem
A minimal shell script build tool that can be used for running shell scripts on
systems that lack any shells.

# hex2_linker
The trivially bootstrappable linker that is designed to be introspectable by
humans and should you so desire assemble hex programs that you write.

# M1-macro
The universal Macro assembler that can target any reasonable hardware architecture.


With these tools on your system, you can always bootstrap real programs; even in
the most catastrophic of situations, provided you keep your cool.
